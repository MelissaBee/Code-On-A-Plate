- 1 teaspoon (3 g) instant yeast
- 1/4 cup (50 g) granulated sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon (3 g) kosher salt
- 2/3 cup (5 1/3 fluid ounces) warm milk (about 95°F)
- 2 eggs (120 g, out of shell) at room temperature, beaten
- 4 tablespoons (56 g) unsalted butter, melted and cooled
- 1/3 cup (about 100 g) Nutella hazelnut spread, warmed a bit to make it more easily spreadable
- Egg wash, for brushing (1 egg + 1 tablespoon water, beaten well)


## Instructions: 

1. In your bowl, place the flour, cream of tartar, instant yeast and sugar, salt and use a handheld whisk to combine well.
2. Add the milk, eggs and butter, and mix on low speed with the dough hook until combined.Raise the mixer speed to medium and knead for 5 minutes.
3.  Spray a silicone spatula lightly with cooking oil spray, and scrape down the sides of the bowl. 
4.  Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl large enough for the dough to rise to double its size.Spray the top of the dough with cooking oil spray, and cover with an oiled piece of plastic wrap

### Preparing the dough for shaping

 1. On baking day, line a small rimmed baking sheet with unbleached parchment paper, and set it aside. Turn out the chilled dough onto a lightly floured surface and using a very light touch, sprinkle the dough with more flour and knead it lightly, sprinkling with flour when necessary to prevent it from sticking.
 2. scrape the dough off the floured surface with a floured bench scraper, then fold it over on itself. Repeat scraping and folding until the dough has become smoother. ***Do not overwork the dough or you will incorporate too much flour and it will not rise properly***

### Rolling out and filling the dough 

1. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a rectangle, sprinkling very lightly with more bread flour as necessary to prevent sticking.
2. Before the dough is fully shaped, transfer it to lightly greased piece of unbleached parchment paper. You will use the parchment paper to help roll the dough into a cylinder. 
3. Beginning at a 15-inch side of the dough,roll the filled dough tightly into a cylinder, ending with the seam side down.

### Final Shaping & Rising 

1.  Once the dough has finished chilling, use a very sharp knife, slice along the length of the dough all the way through to the end. You will have 2 strands of layered dough.  
2.  Beginning at the intact end, twist each strand gently so that the cut sides of the dough are facing up. Braid the strands gently but securely back and forth over one another until you reach the end. You should have 4 or 5 twists before you reach the end.
3.  Transfer the dough to the prepared baking sheet. Once the dough has finished rising, uncover it, brush the surface evenly with the egg wash, and place in the center of the preheated oven. Continue to bake until the dough is golden brown all over (about 15 minutes more).
